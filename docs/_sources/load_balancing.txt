load_balancing.py
=================

This example is inspired by a blog entry from yhathq.
The article is located `here <http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/how-yhat-does-cloud-balancing.html>`_.

This example looks at cloud load balancing to keep a service running in the cloud at reasonable cost 
by reducing the expense of running cloud servers,
minimizing risk and human time due to rebalancing, and doing balance sleeping models across servers.

The different KPIs are optimized in a hierarchical manner: first, the number of active servers is minimized, 
then the total number of migrations is minimized,
and finally the sleeping workload is balanced.
This optimization is achieved by the ``lexicographic_solve()`` method.
