production.py
=============

To meet the demands of its customers, a company manufactures its products in its own factories (inside production) or buys them from other companies (outside production).
The inside production is subject to some resource constraints: each product consumes a certain amount of each resource.
In contrast, outside production is theoretically unlimited. The problem is to determine how much of each product should be
produced inside and outside the company while minimizing the overall production cost, meeting the demand, and satisfying the resource constraints.

The model aims at minimizing the production cost for a number of products while satisfying customer demand.
Each product can be produced either inside the company or outside, at a higher cost.
The inside production is constrained by the company's resources, while outside production is considered unlimited.
The model first declares the products and the resources. The data consists of the description of the products 
(the demand, the inside and outside costs, and the resource consumption) and the capacity of the various resources.

The variables for this problem are the inside and outside production for each product.
