Can linear programming save money on the food budget of the US Army without damaging the nutritional health of members of the armed forces?

This example solves a simple variation of the well-known diet problem that was posed by George Stigler and George Dantzig: how to choose 
foods that satisfy nutritional requirements while minimizing costs or maximizing satiety.

Stigler solved his model "by hand" because technology at the time did not yet support more sophisticated methods.
However, in 1947, Jack Laderman, of the US National Bureau of Standards, applied the simplex method (an algorithm 
that was recently proposed by George Dantzig)
to Stigler's model. Laderman and his team of nine linear programmers, working on desk calculators, showed that Stigler's heuristic approximation was very
close to optimal (only 24 cents per year over the optimum found by the simplex method) and thus demonstrated the practicality of the simplex method
on large-scale, real-world problems.

The problem that is solved in this example is to minimize the cost of a diet that satisfies certain nutritional constraints.
