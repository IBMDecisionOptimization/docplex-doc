===========

Column generation is a solution process that begins with a small, manageable part of a problem (specifically, a few of the variables), 
solves that part,
analyzes the partial solution to determine the next part of the problem (specifically, one or more variables) to add to the model, and then
solves the new, enlarged model. Column generation repeats the process until a satisfactory solution to the whole problem is achieved.
