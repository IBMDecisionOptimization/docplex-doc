===================

How can a sports league schedule matches between teams in different divisions such that the teams play each other 
the appropriate number of times and maximize the objective of scheduling intradivision matches as late 
as possible in the season?

A sports league with two divisions needs to schedule games such that each team plays every team within its division a specified 
number of times and plays every team in the other division a specified number of times. Each week, a team plays exactly one game. 
The preference is for intradivisional matches to be held as late as possible in the season. To model this preference, there is an 
incentive for intradivisional matches; this incentive increases in a non-linear manner by week.
The problem consists of assigning an opponent to each team each week in order to maximize the total of the incentives.

This example works only with the DOcloud optimizer as it exceeds the limits of the Community Edition of 
IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.
