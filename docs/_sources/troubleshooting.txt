Troubleshooting
===============

* What if I get warnings about SSL while my code is running?

  * These types of warnings indicate that you might be using an unsupported version of Python and 
    need additional Python libraries. Some details are provided
    `here <https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/195809/why-do-i-get-a-ssl-certificate-mismatch-error-usin.html>`_.

* How do I check if my local CPLEX Optimizer is used or not?

  * DOcloud examples issue warnings that state whether a CPLEX Optimizer wrapper is present or not. For example, ``CPLEX wrapper is present, version is 12.6.2.0, located at: C:\CPLEX_Studio1262``.
  * If an invalid version of CPLEX Optimizer is detected (for example V12.6.1), DOcloud raises an error that indicates the cause.
  * If no CPLEX Optimizer version is detected, then DOcloud examples raise the messages ``CPLEX wrapper is not available`` and ``Warning: CPLEX DLL not found, will solve on DOcloud``.
  * Look for the ``Environment`` API or the ``verbose`` property of the ``DOcloudContext`` object  to help you diagnose the issue.

* What it I don't have ``pip``?

  * The lack of ``pip`` indicates that you are using an unsupported version of Python since ``pip`` is delivered as a standard package 
    with versions 2.7.9+ and 3.4.
