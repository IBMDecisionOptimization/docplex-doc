Getting started
===============

This section provides all the information that you need to start to use the library.

Installation
------------

This section contains information about installing the IBM Decision
Optimization CPLEX Modeling for Python.

System requirements
"""""""""""""""""""

* **Python with version >= to 2.7.9 or 3.4.x** on 64-bit operating systems: Available from  Python.org.

  * You can download Python `2.7.9 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279>`_ or `3.4.2 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342>`_.

  * A good alternative is to use `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_, which includes a Python interpreter and over 195 of the most popular Python packages for science, math, engineering, and data analysis.

  * This library is not supported on Python 3.5 yet. See `here <https://bitbucket.org/stoneleaf/enum34/issues/5/enum34-incompatible-with-python-35>`_ for more information.

* Only **Windows** and **Linux** operating systems are supported. Your computer must support SSL.

* One of the following options:

  * An **IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud** Service account and API key. You can
    register for a 30-day free trial or buy a subscription
    `here <https://developer.ibm.com/docloud/try-docloud-free>`_.

  * **IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V12.6.2** Development or Deployment edition for solving with no engine limit or
    the Community Edition with engine limits. You can download the Community Edition
    `here <http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/products/optimization/cplex-studio-community-edition>`_.


* See the section on :doc:`Troubleshooting </troubleshooting>` for help diagnosing installation and execution problems.



Installing the CPLEX modeling library
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The DOcplex library can be installed via ``pip`` from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docplex>`_.

Use ``pip`` to install the modeling library:

*  ``pip install docplex``

``pip`` is the standard tool that is used to install Python packages and is included in Python 2.7.9 (and later) and Python 3.4 (and later). See `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ for more details.
Refer to the ``pip`` documentation for easy access to the upgrade, uninstall, and version checking commands.

See :doc:`README.md </README.md>` for a detailed list of dependencies that are automatically downloaded and installed.


Try out DOcplex, no local installation required!
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The easiest way to start experimenting with DOcplex does not involve installing anything on your computer.

Data Scientist Workbench (`datascientistworkbench <https://www.datascientistworkbench.com>`_) is a trial IBM service that provides a hosted Notebook service in the cloud.

Simply create an account and have access to Python from within your browser via an IPython Notebook in a few minutes, then just run ``pip install docplex`` to start writing optimization models.

Installing from source
""""""""""""""""""""""
See the contributing documentation for complete instructions on building from the Git source tree `here <https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/docplex>`_.

After the library is installed, you can optionally download and extract samples from `here <https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/docplex-examples>`_. For more information about these samples, see the :ref:`samples` page.

Looking for a development environment?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
If you are new to Python, you might want a development studio with editors and debuggers. Both `pycharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm>`_ and `pydev <http://www.pydev.org>`_ have free editions.
